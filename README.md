### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hsin Yang

I'm a **Biomechanics Researcher** at **BenQ**, focusing on developing experimental designs and analytical methods for both **eSports** and **traditional sports** performance.

In eSports, my primary research revolves around **First-Person Shooter (FPS) games**, such as **Counter-Strike** and **Valorant**, where I analyze player movement and aim performance.  
In traditional sports, Iâ€™ve worked with disciplines such as **Archery**, **Baseball**, and **Badminton**, applying biomechanics and human movement science to evaluate athlete performance.
